## SoapBox



### `Description`

SopaBox is an spa blogging application where users can create, read, edit or delete blog posts. Liking posts and viewing a profile is also possible.

### `Installation`

To view the site, I recommend going to the live [SoapBox](https://soapbox-blog-app.herokuapp.com/) site hosted on heroku.<br><br>
If you'd like you can also fork and load the site in developement, in conjunction with the rails backend [here](https://github.com/elandau91/mod3-Project-Backend). When loading the site through the repos, make sure to run the rails server on the backend before doing the npm start or yarn start on the frontend repo.
